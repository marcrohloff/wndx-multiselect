WndxMultiselect
==================

At the moment, still stuck on getting Jasmine fixtures to load, so I can test the Javascript.

You can clone this, and then go to spec/rails2 and run "bundle install" (if you are using RVM, I would recommend setting
up a new gemset for this because it's targeting Rails 2.1 for backward compatibility

After that is set up, you can go back up to the root directory and run "rake".  Or, from spec/rails2, you can run
"bundle exec rake".


Requirements
============

jQuery, jQuery UI Autocomplete, jQuery UI Highlight Effect

Example
=======

When it's working, I'll add the examples
